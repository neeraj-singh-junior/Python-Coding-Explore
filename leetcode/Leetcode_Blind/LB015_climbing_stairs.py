        --- problem ---
        [+] You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top. Each time
        you can either climb 1 step or 2 steps.
        [+] In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top ?
        --- problem brief ---
        [+] Let's break down the problem with some examples:
            [-] if n == 1, there is only 1 way to climb the staircase (just take 1 step)
            [-] if n == 2, there are 2 ways to climb the staircase:
            (1 step + 1 step) or (2 steps).
        [+] For larger n, you can think about the last step you take to reach the top.
            If you're at step ùëñ, you could have gotten there either from step i‚àí1 (by taking
            1 step) or from step i‚àí2 (by taking 2 steps).
        [+] Therefore, the total number of ways to reach step i step, is the sum of the number
            of ways to reach step i-1 and the number of ways to reach step i‚àí2.
        [+] The observations is like this,
            ways(i) = ways(i-1) + ways(i-2)
        --- explanation ---
        [+] Base Case Check: If n is 1 or less, return 1 because there's only one way to
            reach step 0 or step 1.
        [+] Initialization: Initialize prev1 and prev2 to 1, representing the number of ways
            to reach step 1 and step 0, respectively.
        [+] Iterative Calculation: For each step from 2 to n, calculate the current number of
            ways as the sum of the ways to reach the previous two steps (prev1 and prev2).
        [+] Update prev2 to prev1 and prev1 to the current number of ways.
