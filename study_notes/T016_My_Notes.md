### MY NOTES : BEGINNING

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Q006 : EPF & EPS terminology in EPFO;;

>>> EPF Wages - Employee Provident Fund(EPF)

EPF wages refer to the basic salary and certain allowances on which
contributions towards the Employees' Provident Fund (EPF) are calculated. 

These wages form the basis for determining the amount an employee and employer
contribute to the EPF account.


#### Components of EPF Wages:


1) EPF wages typically include:

- Basic Salary: The core salary amount before any allowances or deductions.

- Dearness Allowance (DA): A cost-of-living adjustment allowance paid to
  employees to offset the impact of inflation.

- Retaining Allowance: If applicable, this is an allowance paid to retain an
  employee during non-working periods.


2) Exclusions from EPF Wages:

- Certain components of an employee’s salary may not be considered for EPF
  contribution calculation, including:

  1. House Rent Allowance (HRA)
  2. Overtime Allowance
  3. Bonus
  4. Commissions
  5. Conveyance Allowance

#### EPF Contribution Based on EPF Wages:

1) Employee Contribution:
    
  - The employee contributes 12% of their EPF wages 

      (basic salary + DA + retaining allowance)

2) Employer Contribution:

  - The employer also contributes 12% of the employee's EPF wages. However,
    the employer's contribution is divided as follows:

  - 8.33% goes to the Employees' Pension Scheme (EPS) (up to a salary cap of
    ₹15,000).

  - The remaining portion goes to the EPF account.


#### Example of EPF Contribution:

If an employee’s basic salary + DA is ₹20,000 per month:

Employee contribution = 12% of ₹20,000 = ₹2,400
Employer contribution = 12% of ₹20,000 = ₹2,400

Out of this, ₹1,250 goes to EPS (since EPS is calculated on a salary cap of
₹15,000). 

The remaining ₹1,150 goes to EPF. (Read EPS for more)


>>> EPS Wages - Employee Provident Fund(EPF)

EPS wages refer to the part of an employee's salary that is used to calculate
contributions to the Employees' Pension Scheme (EPS), which is a pension
benefit scheme under the Employees' Provident Fund Organization (EPFO). 

The EPS provides employees with a pension after retirement or in cases of
permanent disability, and the amount contributed towards EPS is a part of the
employer's contribution to the overall EPF scheme.

#### EPS Wages and Contribution:

The contribution to the Employees' Pension Scheme (EPS) is calculated as:

- 8.33% of the employee's EPS wages, which is borne by the employer. 

However, there is an important salary cap for EPS wages:

- ₹15,000 per month is the maximum salary on which EPS contributions are
  calculated. This means: 

If your salary (basic + DA) is more than ₹15,000 per month, the EPS
contribution is capped at 8.33% of ₹15,000, which is ₹1,250 per month.

If your salary is less than ₹15,000 per month, the contribution will be 8.33%
of your actual EPS wages.

#### Example of EPS Contribution:

If an employee’s basic salary + DA is ₹20,000 per month:

- EPS contribution = 8.33% of ₹15,000 = ₹1,250 per month (since the salary is
  capped at ₹15,000 for EPS). 

If the employee’s basic salary + DA is ₹12,000 per month:

- EPS contribution = 8.33% of ₹12,000 = ₹999.60 per month.

>>> Differences Between EPS Wages and EPF Wages:

- EPS wages are capped at ₹15,000 for contribution purposes, meaning even if
  an employee earns more than ₹15,000, the EPS contribution is limited to
  this amount.

- EPF wages, on the other hand, are calculated on the full salary without a
  cap (unless the employer applies the salary cap for voluntary purposes).

**Key Points About EPS Wages and Benefits:**

1) Pension Eligibility: To be eligible for a pension under EPS, an employee
must have completed at least 10 years of service.

2) No Interest on EPS: Unlike EPF contributions, EPS does not earn interest.
The amount accumulated in EPS is used to provide pension benefits upon
retirement.

3) Pension Calculation: The pension amount is based on the average of the last
60 months' EPS wages and the number of years of service.

**Why EPS Wages Are Important:**

The higher your EPS wages (up to ₹15,000), the more you contribute to the
pension scheme, which can increase your pension benefits in the future.
However, due to the salary cap, even higher-earning employees will not
contribute more than ₹1,250 per month to EPS, regardless of their actual
salary.

### Q003 : Ignore DB_Store directory in Mac-OS;;

If `.DS_Store` was never added to your git repository, simply add it to your 
`.gitignore` file.

#### Case 1:  If you don't have one, create a file called:
```
.gitignore
```

In you're the root directory of your app and simply write
```
**/.DS_Store
```

In it. This will never allow the .DS_Store file to sneak in your git.

#### Cas 2: if it's already there, write in your terminal:
```
$ find . -name .DS_Store -print0 | xargs -0 git rm -f --ignore-unmatch
```
then commit and push the changes to remove the .DS_Store from your remote repo:
```
# git commit -m "Remove .DS_Store from everywhere"

$ git push origin master
```
And now add .DS_Store to your .gitignore file, and then again commit and push 
with the 2 last pieces of code (git commit..., git push...)


#### Other Solution

If .DS_Store already committed:
```
find . -name .DS_Store -print0 | xargs -0 git rm --ignore-unmatch
```

To ignore them in all repository: (sometimes it named ._.DS_Store)

```
echo ".DS_Store" >> ~/.gitignore_global
echo "._.DS_Store" >> ~/.gitignore_global
echo "**/.DS_Store" >> ~/.gitignore_global
echo "**/._.DS_Store" >> ~/.gitignore_global
git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global
```
