### Q001 : What is ETF Fund;;

ETF stands for `Exchange Traded Funds`, which means you can only buy this ETF 
from an exchanges like NSE or BSE. Unlike Mutual Funds you can't buy this from 
an AMC(Asset Management Company) like Quant or HDFC etc.

or Buying an ETF is like buying a stock.

#### Internal Core Architecture of ETF
- When a user buy ETF then he/she directly put his/her money in the stock.
- To purchase there should be someone ready to sell and vice versa
- You can use regular DEMAT account to buy or sell ETF stock.

#### Keep in Mind
- ETF is stocks, so as happens in stocks. if you want to buy an ETF then there 
should be someone ready to sell at the same time, or simultaneously if you want 
to sell then there should be someone who willing to buy.
- ETF selection can be tricky. So make sure before buying any ETF that there
should be large volume of regular buying or selling. Unless you can
- When you buy an ETF then there are particular charges applicable on it like 
`Securities Transaction Tax` & `Exchange Turnover Charges`. These may be similar
to like Mutual funds charges like `Expense Ratio` & `Exit Load`.

#### Advantage
- ETF apply real time transaction among buyer and seller which apply real time 
stock value transaction. Not as in Mutual funds where you buy a stock in today
's morning then later today's end of the day AMC allotted you the respective 
NAV as per the day end units.
