### NOTEBOOK : BEGINNING

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Q008 : DHT Blockers: Finasteride Vs Minoxidil

#### **1. Minoxidil ‚Äì How It Works & Usage**  

**üü¢ What Is It?**  

- Minoxidil is a topical solution or foam that stimulates hair growth.  

**üü¢ How Does It Work?**  

- **Increases Blood Flow to Hair Follicles** ‚Äì Helps bring more oxygen and
    nutrients to hair roots.  
- **Prolongs the Anagen (Growth) Phase** ‚Äì Keeps hair growing longer before
    shedding.  
- **Activates Dormant Follicles** ‚Äì Encourages miniaturized follicles to start
    producing thicker hair.  

**üü¢ How to Use Minoxidil (Rogaine)?**  

‚úÖ **Dosage:** 5% Minoxidil is recommended for men (2% for women).  
‚úÖ **Application:** Apply **1 mL** of liquid or **half a cap of foam** twice
daily to the affected scalp area.  
‚úÖ **Best Time to Apply:** Morning and night (at least **4 hours before washing
hair**).  
‚úÖ **Absorption Time:** Let it sit for **4 hours** before rinsing or
sleeping. 

**üü¢ Side Effects & Considerations**  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Initial Shredding (First 2-8 Weeks)** ‚Äì This is normal; weak hairs fall
before new, stronger hairs grow.
‚ö†Ô∏è **Scalp Dryness or Itching** ‚Äì Can be avoided with proper moisturizing or
switching to foam-based minoxidil.  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Must Be Used Continuously** ‚Äì If you stop, any hair gained will shed
within months.  

**üü¢ Who Should Use It?**  

- Men with **early to moderate** hair loss (especially in the crown area).  
- Those who **do not want systemic hormonal effects** (like Finasteride).  


## **2. Finasteride ‚Äì How It Works & Usage**  

**üü¢ What Is It?**  

- Finasteride is an **oral medication** that blocks DHT.  

**üü¢ How Does It Work?**  

- **Blocks 5-Alpha Reductase** ‚Äì Stops testosterone from converting
    into **DHT**, the hormone responsible for hair loss.  
- **Prevents Further Hair Loss** ‚Äì Reduces **DHT levels by 70%**, slowing down
    follicle miniaturization.  
- **May Help Regrow Hair** ‚Äì Works best for **maintaining existing hair** but
    may also **regrow hair** in some men.  

**üü¢ How to Use Finasteride?**  

‚úÖ **Dosage:** **1 mg per day** (oral tablet).  
‚úÖ **When to Take It?** Any time of day (with or without food).  
‚úÖ **How Long to See Results?** Takes **3-6 months** for visible results, full effects in **12 months**.  

**üü¢ Side Effects & Considerations**  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Possible Sexual Side Effects** ‚Äì Reduced libido, erectile dysfunction
(in ~1-2% of users).  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Brain Fog & Mood Changes** ‚Äì Rare but reported in some men.  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Must Be Used Long-Term** ‚Äì Stopping Finasteride will **reverse gains
within months**.  

**üü¢ Who Should Use It?**  

- Men with **DHT-related hair loss** (crown, hairline).  
- Those **comfortable with a systemic medication** to **block DHT**.  


#### **3. Can You Use Minoxidil & Finasteride Together?**  

**‚úÖ YES!** Combining **Minoxidil + Finasteride** gives the **best results** because:  

- **Finasteride stops further hair loss** by blocking DHT.  
- **Minoxidil stimulates regrowth** by increasing blood flow and follicle activation.  


#### **üîπ Recommended Treatment Plan for Best Results**  

üíä **Finasteride 1 mg (Daily, Oral)** ‚Äì Prevents hair loss.  
üíß **Minoxidil 5% (Twice Daily, Topical)** ‚Äì Promotes regrowth.  
üß¥ **Ketoconazole Shampoo (2-3x per week)** ‚Äì Helps with scalp health & mild DHT blocking.  


#### **4. Which One Should You Choose?**  

üîπ **If you only want to regrow hair and don‚Äôt want hormonal effects ‚Üí Use Minoxidil (Rogaine).**  
üîπ **If you want to prevent hair loss at the root cause ‚Üí Use Finasteride.**  
üîπ **For the best results ‚Üí Use BOTH together.**  

Would you like help in choosing the right regimen for your hair loss stage, Rey? üòä

### Q007 : Why is DHT Produced in First Place ??

DHT (**Dihydrotestosterone**) is not just a random byproduct‚Äîit plays an
essential role in male development. 

Let‚Äôs break it down step by step :

### **1. Why Does the Body Produce DHT?**  

DHT is derived from **testosterone** through an enzyme called **5-alpha
reductase**. The body produces it for several key reasons:  

- **Male Sexual Development** ‚Äì In the womb, DHT helps form male genitalia.  

- **Puberty Changes** ‚Äì Deep voice, body hair, muscle growth, and sex drive
    are influenced by DHT.  

- **Prostate Growth** ‚Äì It regulates prostate function (but excess DHT can
    cause an enlarged prostate).  

- **Facial & Body Hair Growth** ‚Äì Higher DHT levels promote beard growth but
    also contribute to scalp hair loss.  

So, **DHT is not "bad"‚Äîit‚Äôs just too much of it in the wrong places that
causes problems.**  


### **2. What's Lacking in Male Bodies That Causes Excess DHT?**  

Certain deficiencies or imbalances can **increase DHT production** or **make
hair follicles more sensitive to it**.  

#### **A. Vitamin & Mineral Deficiencies**

- **Zinc Deficiency** ‚Äì Zinc regulates 5-alpha reductase. Low zinc = more DHT
    production.  

- **Vitamin D Deficiency** ‚Äì Low vitamin D levels are linked to increased DHT
    activity in hair follicles.  

- **Magnesium Deficiency** ‚Äì Magnesium helps regulate androgens, preventing
    excessive DHT buildup.  

#### **B. Poor Testosterone-DHT Balance**  

- **Excess Testosterone ‚Üí More DHT** ‚Äì If the body produces more testosterone,
    more of it gets converted into DHT.  
- **Low Estrogen Levels** ‚Äì Some estrogen is needed to balance DHT and prevent
    hair loss.  

#### **C. High 5-Alpha Reductase Activity**  

- Some men **genetically** have **more 5-alpha reductase**, meaning more DHT
  is converted from testosterone.  
- High **insulin resistance** (from too much sugar/carbs) can also increase
  this enzyme.  

#### **D. Scalp Blood Circulation Issues**  

- Poor circulation = weaker hair follicles, making them more **sensitive to DHT**.  

### **3. How to Reduce Excess DHT Naturally?**

If your goal is to **reduce scalp DHT without harming body functions**, focus on:  

- **Increase Zinc & Magnesium Intake** (Pumpkin seeds, almonds, spinach)
- **Support Hormonal Balance** (Healthy fats like avocado, olive oil)
- **Reduce Sugar & Processed Foods** (Helps control insulin, which can trigger DHT production)  
- **Use Natural DHT Blockers** (Saw palmetto, green tea, and rosemary oil)  
- **Improve Scalp Circulation** (Microneedling, scalp massage, exercise)  

### **Final Thought**  

DHT is essential, but when it **over-activates in the scalp**, it leads to
hair loss. The key is **balancing hormones naturally** and reducing scalp
sensitivity to DHT.  


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Q006 : DHT and Male Pattern Baldness ‚Äì Breakdown;;

#### **1. What is DHT?**  

Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is a potent androgen (male hormone) derived from
testosterone. It plays a crucial role in male development (like facial hair,
deep voice, and muscle growth). However, in some men, DHT also contributes
to **male pattern baldness (androgenetic alopecia, AGA)**‚Äîespecially in
the **crown and hairline areas**.  

#### **2. How Does DHT Cause Hair Loss in the Crown?**  

- **Miniaturization of Hair Follicles** : In genetically predisposed men, DHT
    binds to androgen receptors in scalp hair follicles, especially in
    the **crown and frontal areas**.  

- **Shortened Hair Growth Cycle** : DHT shortens the anagen (growth) phase,
    making hair grow thinner and weaker over time.  

- **Increased Shedding** : As hair follicles shrink, they eventually stop
    producing visible hair, leading to bald spots‚Äîmost commonly starting at
    the **crown and hairline**.  

#### **3. Why is the Crown Area Affected?**  

- **Androgen Sensitivity** : The crown has more androgen receptors, making it
    more vulnerable to DHT.  

- **Blood Flow Differences** : Some studies suggest reduced blood circulation
    in the crown compared to the sides and back of the head.  

#### **4. How to Fix or Reduce DHT-Induced Crown Baldness?**  

##### **A. DHT Blockers (Medical Treatments)**

1. **Finasteride (Propecia)**  
   - Blocks **5-alpha reductase**, the enzyme that converts testosterone into DHT.  
   - Slows down hair loss and, in some cases, promotes regrowth.
   - **Side effects**: Lower libido, ED, brain fog in some men.

2. **Dutasteride (Avodart) ‚Äì More Potent**  
   - Stronger than finasteride, blocking both Type I and II **5-alpha reductase**.
   - More effective but also increases the risk of side effects.  

##### **B. Topical Solutions (Less Systemic Side Effects)**

1. **Minoxidil (Rogaine)**  
   - Increases blood flow to hair follicles, prolonging the hair growth phase.  
   - Works best in the **crown area** but does not block DHT.  
   - Takes **3‚Äì6 months** for visible results.  

2. **Topical Finasteride**  
   - Works like oral finasteride but with fewer systemic side effects.  
   - Applied directly to the scalp to **target DHT locally**.  

##### **C. Natural DHT Blockers (Weaker but Safer)**

1. **Saw Palmetto** ‚Äì A natural 5-alpha reductase inhibitor.  
2. **Pumpkin Seed Oil** ‚Äì Has shown some benefits in reducing DHT‚Äôs effects.  
3. **Rosemary Oil** ‚Äì May improve scalp circulation and slightly inhibit DHT.  

##### **D. Hair Transplants (For Severe Baldness)**

- **FUE (Follicular Unit Extraction)** ‚Äì Individual hairs are transplanted to the crown.  
- **FUT (Follicular Unit Transplantation)** ‚Äì A strip of hair is taken from the back and implanted in the crown.  
- **Works best for advanced baldness.**  

##### **E. Lifestyle & Scalp Care**

1. **Low Sugar & High Protein Diet** ‚Äì Reduces DHT production naturally.  
2. **Microneedling (Dermarolling)** ‚Äì Increases blood flow and improves minoxidil absorption.  
3. **DHT-Blocking Shampoos** ‚Äì Contain ketoconazole or caffeine to reduce scalp DHT.  

#### **5. Final Thoughts**

- **If hair loss is early-stage (thinning in crown)** ‚Üí Try **minoxidil + microneedling + natural blockers**.  
- **If hair loss is moderate** ‚Üí Add **finasteride (or topical finasteride) + ketoconazole shampoo**.  
- **If hair loss is advanced (bald crown)** ‚Üí Hair transplant is the best option.

### Q005 : EPF & EPS terminology in EPFO;;

#### **EPF Wages - Employee Provident Fund(EPF)**

EPF wages refer to the basic salary and certain allowances on which
contributions towards the Employees' Provident Fund (EPF) are calculated. 

These wages form the basis for determining the amount an employee and employer
contribute to the EPF account.

> Components of EPF Wages:

1) EPF wages typically include:

- Basic Salary: The core salary amount before any allowances or deductions.

- Dearness Allowance (DA): A cost-of-living adjustment allowance paid to
  employees to offset the impact of inflation.

- Retaining Allowance: If applicable, this is an allowance paid to retain an
  employee during non-working periods.

2) Exclusions from EPF Wages:

- Certain components of an employee‚Äôs salary may not be considered for EPF
  contribution calculation, including:

  1. House Rent Allowance (HRA)
  2. Overtime Allowance
  3. Bonus
  4. Commissions
  5. Conveyance Allowance

> EPF Contribution Based on EPF Wages:

1) Employee Contribution:
    
  - The employee contributes 12% of their EPF wages 

      (basic salary + DA + retaining allowance)

2) Employer Contribution:

  - The employer also contributes 12% of the employee's EPF wages. However,
    the employer's contribution is divided as follows:

  - 8.33% goes to the Employees' Pension Scheme (EPS) (up to a salary cap of
    ‚Çπ15,000).

  - The remaining portion goes to the EPF account.

> Example of EPF Contribution:

If an employee‚Äôs basic salary + DA is ‚Çπ20,000 per month:

Employee contribution = 12% of ‚Çπ20,000 = ‚Çπ2,400
Employer contribution = 12% of ‚Çπ20,000 = ‚Çπ2,400

Out of this, ‚Çπ1,250 goes to EPS (since EPS is calculated on a salary cap of
‚Çπ15,000). 

The remaining ‚Çπ1,150 goes to EPF. (Read EPS for more)


#### **EPS Wages - Employee Provident Fund(EPF)**

EPS wages refer to the part of an employee's salary that is used to calculate
contributions to the Employees' Pension Scheme (EPS), which is a pension
benefit scheme under the Employees' Provident Fund Organization (EPFO). 

The EPS provides employees with a pension after retirement or in cases of
permanent disability, and the amount contributed towards EPS is a part of the
employer's contribution to the overall EPF scheme.

> EPS Wages and Contribution:

The contribution to the Employees' Pension Scheme (EPS) is calculated as:

- 8.33% of the employee's EPS wages, which is borne by the employer. 

However, there is an important salary cap for EPS wages:

- ‚Çπ15,000 per month is the maximum salary on which EPS contributions are
  calculated. This means: 

If your salary (basic + DA) is more than ‚Çπ15,000 per month, the EPS
contribution is capped at 8.33% of ‚Çπ15,000, which is ‚Çπ1,250 per month.

If your salary is less than ‚Çπ15,000 per month, the contribution will be 8.33%
of your actual EPS wages.

> Example of EPS Contribution:

If an employee‚Äôs basic salary + DA is ‚Çπ20,000 per month:

- EPS contribution = 8.33% of ‚Çπ15,000 = ‚Çπ1,250 per month (since the salary is
  capped at ‚Çπ15,000 for EPS). 

If the employee‚Äôs basic salary + DA is ‚Çπ12,000 per month:

- EPS contribution = 8.33% of ‚Çπ12,000 = ‚Çπ999.60 per month.

> Differences Between EPS Wages and EPF Wages:

- EPS wages are capped at ‚Çπ15,000 for contribution purposes, meaning even if
  an employee earns more than ‚Çπ15,000, the EPS contribution is limited to
  this amount.

- EPF wages, on the other hand, are calculated on the full salary without a
  cap (unless the employer applies the salary cap for voluntary purposes).

**Key Points About EPS Wages and Benefits:**

1) Pension Eligibility: To be eligible for a pension under EPS, an employee
must have completed at least 10 years of service.

2) No Interest on EPS: Unlike EPF contributions, EPS does not earn interest.
The amount accumulated in EPS is used to provide pension benefits upon
retirement.

3) Pension Calculation: The pension amount is based on the average of the last
60 months' EPS wages and the number of years of service.

#### **Why EPS Wages Are Important:**

The higher your EPS wages (up to ‚Çπ15,000), the more you contribute to the
pension scheme, which can increase your pension benefits in the future.
However, due to the salary cap, even higher-earning employees will not
contribute more than ‚Çπ1,250 per month to EPS, regardless of their actual
salary.
