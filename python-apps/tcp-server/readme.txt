USER DATAGRAM PROTOCOL:
-> UDP is the abbreviation of User Datagram Protocol. UDP makes use of
   Internet Protocol of the TCP/IP suit. In communications using UDP, a
   client program sends a message packet to a destination server wherein the
   destination server also runs on UDP.

Properties of UDP:

-> The UDP does not provide guaranteed delivery of message packets. If for
   some issue in a network if a packet is lost it could be lost forever.
-> Since there is no guarantee of assured delivery of messages, UDP is
   considered an unreliable protocol.
-> The underlying mechanisms that implement UDP involve no connection-based
   communication. There is no streaming of data between a UDP server or and
   an UDP Client.
-> An UDP client can send "n" number of distinct packets to an UDP server and
   it could also receive "n" number of distinct packets as replies from the
   UDP server.
-> Since UDP is connectionless protocol the overhead involved in UDP is less
   compared to a connection based protocol like TCP.
