###---Sql NOTES : BEGINNING 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> Q014 : COUNT(*) vs COUNT(1) in Sql;;

(Future : https://learnsql.com/blog/difference-between-count-distinct)

###--- COUNT(*)
-> The COUNT(*) returns the total number of rows in a table, including the
   NULLs. 

###--- COUNT(1) 
-> The COUNT(1) function replaces all records from the query result set with
   value 1. If you have NULL values, it is also replaced by 1. Therefore,
   COUNT(1) also returns the total number of records (including NULLs) in the
   table.

-> Similarly,if you used count(2), count(3), count(1000), count(-100) all will
   have the same result No different.

-> Even if you use the string in the count() function the final result will be
   the same as for count(*).

###--- COUNT(COLUMN_NAME)
-> If we specify a column name in the SQL COUNT function argument, it counts
   the total number of rows in the table and excludes the NULL in the
   specified column. 

###--- COUNT(DISTINCT COLUMN_NAME)
-> It will count the normal distinct value count only. As what the distinct
   keyword do.

###--- FALSE MISCONCEPTION 
-> There’s a popular misconception that “1” in COUNT(1) means “count the
   values in the first column and return the number of rows.” From that
   misconception follows a second: that COUNT(1) is faster because it will
   count only the first column, while COUNT(*)

### --- CONCLUSION
-> COUNT(*) returns counts of all the rows, including NULLs
-> COUNT(1) returns counts of all the rows, including NULLs
-> COUNT(column_name) counts of all the rows, excluding NULLs.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> Q013 : COUNT & GROUP BY in Sql;;

-> COUNT: It is used to count the number of rows in table.
-> GROUP BY: When we count rows then we have to group the rows with respects
   to the column for which you want the count.

eg1: Count the number of students enrolled in all course and course is not null.

select course, count(*) NoOfStudents
from students
where course is not null
group by course

eg2: Find all grades and the maximum age of students in each grade. The column
header for "maximum age" should be maxAge.

SELECT grade, max(age) as maxAge
FROM students
where grade is not null
group by grade

eg3 : Find all the distinct courses and the minimum marks students have scored
in each course. The column header for "minimum marks" should be minMarks.

SELECT course, min(marks) as minMarks
FROM students
where course is not null
group by course

eg4 : Find all distinct courses and the total sum of all marks students have
scored in each course. The column header for "sum of marks" should be
sumOfMarks.

SELECT course, sum(marks) as sumOfMarks
FROM students
where course is not null 
group by course

eg5: Find all distinct grades and the average of all marks students have
scored in each grade. The column header for "average of all marks" should be
avgOfMarks.

select grade, avg(marks)
from students
where grade is not null
group by grade

###------ GROUP BY Modified Column Data 
-> We can apply group by on non-exisiting table column or one which is
   rendered by the sql query builder.

eg6: We want to count the number of students for unique length of names.

SELECT LENGTH(name) AS nameLength, COUNT(*) AS countOfStudents
FROM students
GROUP BY LENGTH(name)

eg7: Write a query which shows the number of students who have got marks in
single digits (0-9) and the number of students who got marks in double
digits (10-99).

select length(marks) as digitsInMarks, 
count(*) as noOfStudents
from students
group by length(marks)

###------ GROUP BY with ORDERING (ORDER BY)

eg8: Write Query to fetch no. of students in each grade and sort the no. of
students in descending order.

select grade, count(*) as studentsCount
from students
where grade is not null
group by grade
order by count(*) desc

eg9: Write a query to list all unique not-null courses and the maximum marks
obtained in each of them as "maxMarks" by the students in ascending order

select course, max(marks) as maxMarks
from students
where course is not null 
group by course
order by marks asc

###------ GROUP BY with FILTER (HAVING)

-> HAVING clause is used with the group by clause when there is a need to add
   filteration among the grouped data.

eg10: Write a SQL query to list only unique not-null courses having average
marks obtained in each them between 30 and 69, along with the average marks
obtained in each of them as avgMarks, sorted in the descending order of the
avgMarks scored in them.

select course, avg(marks) as avgMarks
from students
where course is not null
group by course
having avg(marks) between 30 and 69
order by avg(marks) desc

eg11: List all no. of students in every course having student count geater
than 2.

select grade, count(*) as noOfStudents
from students
where grade is not null
group by grade
having count(1) > 2

###------ GROUP BY with MULTIPLE COLUMNS

-> When you are fetching only one column (excluding dynamically rendered
   column) then everything works fine. But things gets messy as soon as you
   include more than two columns in single group by. To overcome such things,
   you 've to include multiple columns in the single group by clause.

eg



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> Q012 : COALESCE vs IFNULL in Sql;;

-> COALESCE is useful when you have unknown number of values that you want to
   check and IFNULL is useful when you select columns and know that it can be
   null but you want to represent it with a different value.
-> COALESCE function can take two or more parameters and returns the first
   non-NULL parameter, or NULL and IFNULL function takes two arguments and
   returns the first one if it's not NULL or the second if the first one is
   NULL.

eg1, Difference of COALESCE Vs IFNULL

SELECT IFNULL('some value', 'some other value');
-- returns 'some value'

SELECT IFNULL(NULL,'some other value');
-- returns 'some other value'

SELECT COALESCE(NULL, 'some other value');
-- returns 'some other value' - equivalent of the IFNULL function

SELECT COALESCE(NULL, 'some value', 'some other value');
-- returns 'some value'

SELECT COALESCE(NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'first non-null value');
-- returns 'first non-null value'


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> Q011 : COALESCE Clause in Sql;;

-> COALESCE function is used to select first not-null value in the list of inputs.

eg, Let's say we want to display the name of all students with one additional
data point. If age is available, then print it. If age is not available, then
we print the grade value. If the grade is also NULL, then we print the course
value. If the course value is NULL as well, we return NULL

SELECT name, coalesce(age, grade, course) AS "age or grade or course"
FROM students


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> Q010 : IFNULL Clause in Sql;;

-> IFNULL is simply to implement a check of a value being NULL 
-> IFNULL accepts 2 arguments. 
	1) The first argument is the column that needs to be picked
	2) Fallback value if the first column is set to null.

eg1: Select all grade and print no grade if grade is null

select name, ifnull(grade, 'no other')
from students

or, we can also do it with the case statement. Like

select name, 
case 
	when grade is not null then grade
else
	'no grade'
from students


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> Q009 : Concatenation in Sql;;

-> We use || operator to concatenate data from different columns 

eg1: Display name and email in a single column

select name||','||email as contacts
from students


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> Q008 : Case Clause in Sql;;

-> Case in sql is used for the implementation of the if-else block in
   programming language.
-> Syntax: 
	case when something = True then 'this happens' else 'This one' end 

Note that the way conditional expressions in SQL are written, differs from
database to database. Sqlite3 used the conditional operator CASE and Portgres
also used the same But MySql have different syntax. Like,

MYSQL SYNTAX : 

select name, 
if(course in ('Python', 'Ruby'), 
	'Then This will Execute', 
	'Otherwise this will work')
from students


eg1 : Display students result and the value of "result" should be be "passed"
if marks is greater than 33. Otherwise "failed".

SELECT name, marks, 
case when marks > 33 then 'passed' else 'failed' end as result
FROM students


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> Q007 : Modify Data from Rows in Sql;;

-> You can add boolean clauses in select statements

eg1: Display name and age of students along with the information whether they
are a teenager or not.

SELECT name, age, (age BETWEEN 13 AND 19) AS isTeenager
FROM students

eg2 : Let's say that a student is considered underage if the difference
between the age and the grade is 5 or less.

SELECT name, age, grade, (age-grade <= 5) as isUnderage
FROM students


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> Q006 : Arithmetic Operation in Sql;;

-> Arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
   and modulo can be applied on an individual column.

eg1: Show arithmetic operatoin

SELECT age / 2, age * 2
FROM students

eg2: Display the length of name of students incremented by 1 and marks of
students rounded to nearest multiple of 10 less than or equal to marks

SELECT 
length(name) + 1 as incremented_length, 
marks-marks%10 as rounded_marks
FROM students

eg3: List the names, ages and marks of students where the sum of age and marks
is between 30 and 70.

select name, age, marks
from students
where (age + marks) between 30 and 70

eg4: Display the name, age and marks of students whose age is an even number
and marks are an odd number.

SELECT name, age , marks
FROM students
where age % 2 = 0 and marks % 2 <> 0

eg5: Display the name, age and grade of students in the ascending order of
difference of their age and grade for students who have both age data and
grade data.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> Q005 : Modulus in Sql;;

-> SQL can perform arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, division
   or modulus.
-> Modulus is the remainder of a division between two numbers. It is
   represented by the symbol %.


eg1: show modulo between 10 and 3

select 10 % 3;
-- output : 1

eg2: Find all students having ids even

select * from students where id % 2 = 0;


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> Q004 : Strftime function in sql;;

-> STRFTIME is a SQL function that can be used over DATETIME to extract
   specific information.
-> Here are a few basic parameters used for date extractions. Like,
	- %d ~ day of month: 00
	- %m ~ month: 01-12
	- %Y ~ year: 2023
	- %H ~ hour: 00-24
	- %M ~ minutes: 00-60
	- %S ~ seconds: 00-60
	- %f ~ fractional seconds: SS.SSS ~ 59.001
	- %j ~ day of the year: 001- 366
	- %J ~ julian day number
	- %s ~ seconds since 1970-01-01
	- %w ~ day of week :0 to 6 with 0 -> Sunday
	- %W ~ week of year: 00-53

eg1, Print month of the current date

SELECT STRFTIME('%m', DATETIME('Now'))

eg2, Format the whole date

select strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S', datetime('now'))

eg 3, Write a query to display the datetime timestamps
1) for time exactly 4 days after the current time in UTC
2) time at the beginning of the current day in UTC 

SELECT 
strftime('%d/%m/%Y %H:%M', datetime('now', '+4 days')) as time4DaysLater,
strftime('%d/%m/%Y %H:%M', datetime('now', 'start of day')) 
as timeCurrentDayStart

-- time4dayslater : 04/06/2023 15:42
-- timecurrentdaystart : 31/05/2023 00:00


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> Q003 : Date and Time function in sql;;

###----Date 
- Date function is used to display the date of today.

eg 1 : Let's use the DATE function to display today's date along with the name
and course of all students.

SELECT DATE('Now')
-- output: 2023-05-31

###---- Time 
-> Time() function is used to display the time in current instances;

eg2 : Dispaly time in sql query

select time('now')

###---- DateTime() function
-> The DATETIME function combines the features of both DATE and TIME
   functions. It displays both date and time together.
-> The time shown by DATETIME is UTC time by default. If we want to display
   the local time, we can add a parameter 'localtime' to the DATETIME
   function .
-> There are modifiers like 
	1) 'start of day'
	2) 'start of month'
	3) 'start of year'
	4) '+2 days'
	5) '-2 days'
	6) '+2 months'
	7) '+2 months'
 
eg3: Display localtime 

SELECT DATETIME('NOW', 'localtime')

###---- DateTime() Modifiers 
-> We can also add or subtract date time from current date time

eg4: For adding 2 days in current datetime

select datetime('now', '+2 days')
-- 2023-06-02 14:57:21

and, this modifier also work with date() function

eg4.1: For adding two days with date() function 

select date('now', '+2 days')
-- 2023-06-02

eg 4.2: for subtracting 2 months from the current date

select datetime('now', '-2 days')

and with date() function

select date('now', '-2 days ')

eg 4.3: for subtracting 2 months from the current date

select datetime('now', '-2 months')
-- 2023-03-31 15:02:28

and, similarly with date() function 

select date('now', '-2 months')
-- 2023-03-31

eg 4.4: for datetime timestamp of +3 years to the current localtime

select datetime('now', 'localtime', '3 years')
-- UTC TIME + 3year

and, if you want 

eg 4.5: some other modifiers are

SELECT DATETIME('now', 'localtime', 'Start of Day');

SELECT DATETIME('now', 'localtime', 'Start of Month');

SELECT DATETIME('now', 'localtime', 'Start of Year');


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> Q002 : Sql Length function;;
- SQL has a LENGTH function which can be used for counting the length of
  string, number etc.
- LENGTH can also be used on number or integer columns in addition to string
  columns.
- We can use LENGTH in ORDER BY clause to get this result.

 
eg 1 : Let's say we want to select the length of the names of students along
with their names.
 
SELECT name, LENGTH(name)
FROM students

eg 2 : Find unique course names which are of length 4.

SELECT DISTINCT course
FROM students
WHERE LENGTH(course) = 4

eg 3 : List the names of students in the ascending order of length of their
names.

select name 
from students 
order by length(name) asc


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> Q001 : Sql Core  Fundamentals Topics;;

###----------------  Select 
SELECT to select all the columns and all the data from the table.

eg, 
select * 
from students;

###--------------- Where
WHERE is used to filterout data from the table.

eg, 
select * 
from student 
where couse = 'English';

###----------------  Not
We can use not equal to operator != to get the job done.

eg,
SELECT * 
FROM students 
WHERE age != 12

###---------------- Less Than
We can use < to perform a less than operation.

eg, 
SELECT * 
FROM students 
WHERE grade < 8

###---------------- Greater Than
We can use > to perform a greater than operation.

eg, 
SELECT * 
FROM students 
WHERE age > 13

###---------------- Less Than Equals to 
We can use <= to perform a less than or equal to operation.

eg, 
SELECT * 
FROM students 
WHERE age <= 7

###---------------- Greater Than Equals to 
We can use >= to perform a greater than or equal to operation.

eg, 
SELECT *
FROM students
WHERE grade >= 9

###---------------- Sql Comments
We can use comments in SQL too to mark part of code not to be run.

eg,
SELECT *
FROM students
-- WHERE grade < 8

###---------------- Multiple Line Comments
Let's say we have a query to get all students whose grade is less than 8.

eg,
/* 
Multi-Line Comment in Sql Language !!!
*/

SELECT *
FROM students
WHERE age < 13

###---------------- AND Operation
We can use AND operator to combine the two conditions.

eg,
SELECT *
FROM students
WHERE age > 10
AND course = 'JavaScript'

###---------------- OR Operation
We can use OR operator to combine the three conditions. If one of the
conditions is true then that record will be selected since we are using OR
operator.

eg, 
SELECT *
FROM students
WHERE age > 15
OR course = 'Java'
OR grade = 7

###---------------- Both AND & OR
We need to use both AND as well as OR to solve this problem.

eg, Find all students who are of age 15 or of age 13 or of age 12 and belong
to a grade lesser than 9.

SELECT *
FROM students 
where (grade < 9) and
(age = 15 or age = 13 or age = 12)


###---------------- Between 
One way of doing this would be using OR.

eg, Find all students who are of age between 12 and 15.

SELECT *
FROM students
WHERE age BETWEEN 12 and 15

###---------------- Between and Other Condition
We can use BETWEEN & AND condition to solve this.

eg, Find all students who belong to grades between 8 and 12 and they are
enrolled in course C#.

SELECT *
FROM students
WHERE (course = 'C#') and 
(grade BETWEEN 8 and 12)

###---------------- Not Between 
One way of doing this would be using WHERE in combination with less than and
greater than operators.

eg, Find all students who don't have marks between 30 and 70.

select *
from students
where marks NOT BETWEEN 30 AND 70;

alternatively , 

select * 
from students
where not marks between 30 and 70;

###---------------- IN 
In operator is used to find values from a list of collections

eg, Find all student having grades 6,9,12

SELECT *
FROM students
WHERE grade IN (6, 9, 12)

###---------------- NOT IN 
NOT In is just used to find the opposite of IN collections.

eg, Find those grade not in (2, 3, 5, 7, 11)

SELECT *
FROM students
WHERE grade  NOT IN (2, 3, 5, 7, 11)

alternative,

SELECT *
FROM students
WHERE NOT grade IN (2, 3, 5, 7, 11)

###---------------- Null 
In database we represent missing information as NULL.

eg, Find all students whose age information is not available.

SELECT *
FROM students
WHERE age IS NULL

Find those student age is missing or course is missing

select *
from students 
where age is null or course is null 

###---------------- NOT Null
Find all information who row is not missing.

eg, Find all students whose grade information is available.

SELECT *
FROM students
WHERE grade IS NOT NULL

###---------------- Like 
We can use % with LIKE to solve this find any string pattern

eg, Find all students who are enrolled in a course that starts with P.

SELECT  *
FROM students 
where course like 'P%';

###---------------- NOT Like
We can use % with NOT LIKE to solve this.

eg, Find all students who are enrolled in a course that does not start with
Ja.

SELECT *
FROM students
WHERE course NOT LIKE 'Ja%'


###---------------- DISTINCT
Distinct is used to fetch the unique record from a row.

eg, Find all the unique age of all the students.

SELECT distinct age
FROM students;

###---------------- COUNT
The count function is used to count the number of rows.

An aggregate function is used to perform some calculations on data. Count,
average, sum, maximum and minimum are examples of aggregate function.

eg, Let's find the total number of students.

select count(*) from students

alternatively, both query are same 

select count(all name) from students

###---------------- AS
AS is used to change the header of the column.

eg, Let's display only the id, grade and course of students. The column name
for ids should be studentId and the column name for grades should be
studentGrade.

SELECT
id as studentId,
grade as studentGrade,
course
FROM students;

###---------------- COUNT with DISTINCT
count distinct give distinct count of all the rows of the database.

eg, find all distinct courses.

SELECT DISTINCT(course)
FROM students

###---------------- SUM and AVG
-> Sum : Sum aggregate sums up all the values from the result

eg, Find the sum of all distinct marks under 50 and name it
sumOfDistinctMarks.

SELECT sum(distinct marks) as sumOfDistinctMarks
FROM students
where marks < 50;

-> Avg : Avg aggregate average of all the marks. 

eg, Find the average of all the marks. AVG can be used to solve this.

SELECT AVG(marks)
FROM students

###---------------- MAX and MIN
-> Max : Max returns the maximum of all the not-null values in the column
   mentioned next to it.

eg, Calculate the maximum marks among all the students who are enrolled in the
Python course.

select max(marks)
from students
where course = 'Python'

-> Min : Min returns the Minimum of all the not-null values in the column
   mentioned next to it.

eg, calculate the minimum age.

SELECT min(age)
FROM students

###---------------- Select Multiple Data
We can select multiple columns and perform some mathematical operation on
these columns. Suppose, we want to get the total age of all the students and
the maximum marks in the same query.

eg. Let's calculate the minimum marks, the maximum marks and the count of
distinct courses and name them as minMarks, maxMarks and countOfCourses
respectively.

SELECT min(marks) as minMarks,
max(marks) as maxMarks,
count(distinct course) as countOfCourses
FROM students

###---------------- ORDER BY
order by is used to order the result row in ascending or descending pattern.

eg1,
Find name, grade, and age of all students, sorted in increasing order of their age.

SELECT name, grade, age
FROM students 
order by age asc

eg2,
Find name, grade, age, and marks of students, in the increasing order of grade
first, then age and then marks.

SELECT name, grade, age, marks
FROM students
order by grade, age, marks

eg3, Find name, marks and age of all students, and order them by age in
ascending order first and then sort them in descending order of marks.

SELECT name, marks, age
FROM students
ORDER BY age ASC, marks DESC

###---------------- LIMIT
Limit is used to select specific number of rows from the results 

eg4,
Select 6 students above age 9

SELECT  *
FROM students
where age > 9
limit 6;

###---------------- OFFSET
SQL provides OFFSET which sets the starting position. When we use LIMIT then
we take a number of records from the top. It means starting position is 0.

eg, Let's say that we want to find students who are at position 6, position 7,
position 8, position 9 and position 10. You have to skip the first 5 position
of the customer

select *
from students 
limit 5
offset 5
